# Questionnaire Web
<p >
                Introducing "Questionnaire Web" - a dynamic front-end project designed to facilitate quizzes or gather valuable feedback from customers. 
                This user-friendly web application offers a seamless experience for both customers and administrators.

                Upon accessing the website, users are greeted with a registration form. For regular users, 
                they simply need to input their phone number to proceed. However, administrators have the option to enter an 
                admin password instead. After registration, users are directed to the quiz section. By The Way for admin password is <strong>admin12345</strong>. However it can be customized.
                </p>
                <p>
                The quiz section presents users with a series of questions and multiple-choice variants. 
                Users have the flexibility to select more than one answer for each question. 
                Once the questions have been answered, users are prompted to choose from three available operators. 
                After submitting their responses, users are redirected to a gratitude-filled "Thank You" page.
                </p>
                <p>
                "Questionnaire Web" aims to cater to a diverse user base by providing support for two languages: 
                Uzbek and Russian. Users can effortlessly switch between these languages by clicking on the language 
                selection option located at the top of the navigation bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                Furthermore, the project includes an admin panel that offers customization capabilities. 
                Within the customization page, administrators can find two containers, each representing the Uzbek and Russian 
                languages. These containers provide the ability to modify questions, add new ones, delete existing questions, 
                and manage variants.
                </p>
                <p>
                In addition, the admin panel features an answers list page that showcases the submissions received from users. 
                The table-based content within this page is intelligently sorted based on the operators selected by users during 
                their answer submissions. The table includes columns for operators and phone numbers. Clicking on a 
                phone number redirects administrators to a detailed user item page. This page provides a comprehensive overview of 
                the user's submission data, including the specific questions and answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                While the front-end development has been successfully implemented, 
                there remains a backend aspect to be completed for the project. 
                This pending task will further enhance the functionality and live data influence flow of "Questionnaire Web."
                </p>
                <p>
                With its intuitive user interface, multi-language support, and comprehensive admin panel, 
                "Questionnaire Web" offers a versatile platform for conducting quizzes or feedbacks from clients,  
                and efficiently managing the customization and administration aspects of the application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
