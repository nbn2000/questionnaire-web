                Upon accessing the website, users are greeted with a registration form. For regular users, 
                they simply need to input their phone number to proceed. However, administrators have the option to enter an 
                admin password instead. After registration, users are directed to the quiz section. By The Way for admin password is <strong>admin12345</strong>. However it can be customized.

                The quiz section presents users with a series of questions and multiple-choice variants. 
                Users have the flexibility to select more than one answer for each question. 
                Once the questions have been answered, users are prompted to choose from three available operators. 
                After submitting their responses, users are redirected to a gratitude-filled "Thank You" page.

                "Questionnaire Web" aims to cater to a diverse user base by providing support for two languages: 
                Uzbek and Russian. Users can effortlessly switch between these languages by clicking on the language 
                selection option located at the top of the navigation bar.

                Furthermore, the project includes an admin panel that offers customization capabilities. 
                Within the customization page, administrators can find two containers, each representing the Uzbek and Russian 
                languages. These containers provide the ability to modify questions, add new ones, delete existing questions, 
                and manage variants.

                In addition, the admin panel features an answers list page that showcases the submissions received from users. 
                The table-based content within this page is intelligently sorted based on the operators selected by users during 
                their answer submissions. The table includes columns for operators and phone numbers. Clicking on a 
                phone number redirects administrators to a detailed user item page. This page provides a comprehensive overview of 
                the user's submission data, including the specific questions and answers.

                While the front-end development has been successfully implemented, 
                there remains a backend aspect to be completed for the project. 
                This pending task will further enhance the functionality and live data influence flow of "Questionnaire Web."

                With its intuitive user interface, multi-language support, and comprehensive admin panel, 
                "Questionnaire Web" offers a versatile platform for conducting quizzes or feedbacks from clients,
